Use strict requires the author of a program to explicitly state that something is a variable with 'my'. This can prevent confusion in the event of a typo or a similar error. Additionally, the author cannot reuse the same variable name for different value types, such as numbers and hashes. and the author cannot use bareword identifiers improperly, like doing '$string = hello'. Overall, it makes the author be more explicit in how they use variables.
