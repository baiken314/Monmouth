1)
a)
Intended output:
verylongvarname: 11

Actual output:
verylongvarname: 10

b)
Here, the weak typing system did not catch the error made by the programmer because it is syntactically correct, because the variable verylongvarnaem is initialized as a new variable. In strong typed languages like C or Java, this would be caught as a syntax error because by editing a variable that was never declared will return an exception.

2)
a)
Python is a dynamically typed language, so by nature it does not have an equivalent 'use strict;' mode as Perl does. Misnaming a variable will initialize a new one. You can import typing and declare variables as certain types, but at runtime any misnamed variables will be initialized.

b)
python -W all progname.py is Python's version of Perl's -w argument to show warnings when running a program.

c)
A Python programmer would have to be more careful when editing variables, however, there are ways to prevent accidentally initializing a new variable. If the line was replaced to be verylongvarnaem += 1, it would return an error at runtime or in an IDE because that variable does not exist and the error would be caught.
