Obaidat was featured in the Asbury Park Press on 2/25/2012.     (Excerpt:) Mohammad S. Obaidat, a professor of computer science and software engineering at Monmouth University and the editor-in-chief of several technical journals, said early predictions of a paperless culture were just premature, not wholly inaccurate. A Business Week article in June 1975 offered diverging views on the paperless office, an early mention of the concept. The tipping point of the decline of world paper use arrived as the Internet, e-business, e-government and social media made large strides, Obaidat said. Those developments rose along with the expansion of the economies of India and China, which allowed far more people to acquire information technology devices. Obaidat ticked off some of the benefits of a paperless world: fewer environmental issues like deforestation and greenhouse gas buildup, less space needed, greater searchability, reduced costs. &quot;But are we ever going to be 100 percent paperless? I doubt it,&quot; Obaidat said. Obaidat predicted that world paper consumption will decline by 75 percent by 2020. Steps like Google&#039;s efforts to digitize existing books and the widespread acceptance of electronic signatures will speed the drop. &quot;The world will be digital,&quot; Obaidat said.   Read more...   2/2/12 CS Alumnus Featured in School of Science Newsletter Michael Barnathan, CS &#039;06   Michael Barnathan (BS in CS, 2006) is the featured alumnus in the Spring 2012 issue of Science Buzz, the School of Science e-newsletter.

The MS Degree will now require 30 credits (10 courses) for students with an adequate CS background (those who do not need to take any bridge courses). These students will be able to finish the degree in 1 calendar year (2 semesters and 1 summer). In the new graduate program, new students will choose between: Track A (thesis) Track B (non-thesis) Additionally, students will have the option of choosing one of the following areas of specialization: Databases and Intelligent Information Systems Security of Networks and Information Systems Computer Networks Students also will have the option of not choosing an area of specialization.   4/13/08 Significant CS Program Changes Starting Academic Year 2008 We would like to announce two recent program changes starting in the Fall 2008 semester. First, our initial instructional programming language has been changed to Java from C++ for both the B.S. and M.S. programs. With this change, the typical undergraduate student will begin their study of computer science by first taking CS 120 &quot;Foundations of Computer Science&quot; in the fall and then learning to program using the Java programming language in CS 175 &quot;Introduction to Computer Science I&quot; which is offered during the spring semester. Students who have an advanced placement score of 3 or better in CS can be given credit for CS 175 and can, therefore, continue their study of Java from high school by taking CS 176 during their first semester (fall) at Monmouth. Students will be introduced to C++ when they take CS 310 &quot;Object Oriented Programming and Design&quot; during their junior year. In the Graduate program, the bridge courses that involve programming – CS 501A, CS 501B, and CS 503 – will now use Java for instruction. Graduate students will now be exposed to programming in C++ in CS 509. Second, we now have two tracks in the BS program. Track A: Advanced Computing. This track is recommended for students who plan to go on to a graduate degree in computer science or who are interested in mathematical or scientific computing. Honors students must take this track. The track requires 26 credits of mathematics and science outside of the major. Track B: Applied Computing. The requirements within the major are identical to track A, but the only requirement outside of the major beyond the General Education requirements of Monmouth University is that the student take Math 109 &quot;Pre-Calculus Mathematics&quot; (or obtain an appropriate score in the mathematics placement test).

Obaidat was featured in the Asbury Park Press on 2/25/2012.     (Excerpt:) Mohammad S. Obaidat, a professor of computer science and software engineering at Monmouth University and the editor-in-chief of several technical journals, said early predictions of a paperless culture were just premature, not wholly inaccurate. A Business Week article in June 1975 offered diverging views on the paperless office, an early mention of the concept. The tipping point of the decline of world paper use arrived as the Internet, e-business, e-government and social media made large strides, Obaidat said. Those developments rose along with the expansion of the economies of India and China, which allowed far more people to acquire information technology devices. Obaidat ticked off some of the benefits of a paperless world: fewer environmental issues like deforestation and greenhouse gas buildup, less space needed, greater searchability, reduced costs. &quot;But are we ever going to be 100 percent paperless? I doubt it,&quot; Obaidat said. Obaidat predicted that world paper consumption will decline by 75 percent by 2020. Steps like Google&#039;s efforts to digitize existing books and the widespread acceptance of electronic signatures will speed the drop. &quot;The world will be digital,&quot; Obaidat said.   Read more...   2/2/12 CS Alumnus Featured in School of Science Newsletter Michael Barnathan, CS &#039;06   Michael Barnathan (BS in CS, 2006) is the featured alumnus in the Spring 2012 issue of Science Buzz, the School of Science e-newsletter.

The MS Degree will now require 30 credits (10 courses) for students with an adequate CS background (those who do not need to take any bridge courses). These students will be able to finish the degree in 1 calendar year (2 semesters and 1 summer). In the new graduate program, new students will choose between: Track A (thesis) Track B (non-thesis) Additionally, students will have the option of choosing one of the following areas of specialization: Databases and Intelligent Information Systems Security of Networks and Information Systems Computer Networks Students also will have the option of not choosing an area of specialization.   4/13/08 Significant CS Program Changes Starting Academic Year 2008 We would like to announce two recent program changes starting in the Fall 2008 semester. First, our initial instructional programming language has been changed to Java from C++ for both the B.S. and M.S. programs. With this change, the typical undergraduate student will begin their study of computer science by first taking CS 120 &quot;Foundations of Computer Science&quot; in the fall and then learning to program using the Java programming language in CS 175 &quot;Introduction to Computer Science I&quot; which is offered during the spring semester. Students who have an advanced placement score of 3 or better in CS can be given credit for CS 175 and can, therefore, continue their study of Java from high school by taking CS 176 during their first semester (fall) at Monmouth. Students will be introduced to C++ when they take CS 310 &quot;Object Oriented Programming and Design&quot; during their junior year. In the Graduate program, the bridge courses that involve programming – CS 501A, CS 501B, and CS 503 – will now use Java for instruction. Graduate students will now be exposed to programming in C++ in CS 509. Second, we now have two tracks in the BS program. Track A: Advanced Computing. This track is recommended for students who plan to go on to a graduate degree in computer science or who are interested in mathematical or scientific computing. Honors students must take this track. The track requires 26 credits of mathematics and science outside of the major. Track B: Applied Computing. The requirements within the major are identical to track A, but the only requirement outside of the major beyond the General Education requirements of Monmouth University is that the student take Math 109 &quot;Pre-Calculus Mathematics&quot; (or obtain an appropriate score in the mathematics placement test). This track is appropriate for students who plan to go directly to work in the software industry after graduation or to follow their undergraduate education with, for example, an MBA.   4/10/08 CS Students Present Research At Seventh Annual STE Student Research Conference Two CompSci students presented posters at the Seventh Annual STE Student Research Conference.

<p>Senior CS majors Patricia Skora and Victoria Johnson, representing their company CheckMate, won first place in MU’s November TechPitch competition. They developed and presented a sailing competition verification app, VERISail, which would help inspectors at sailing events ensure that competing sailboats are class approved. VERISail would work with manufacturers of sailboat components to include QR codes and holograms that inspectors could quickly scan to verify compliance at competitions, easing a previously tedious and error-prone process. Skora and Johnson will represent the university at the November 19 TechLaunch Bullpen #15 event in Pozycki Auditorium.</p>
<p>The second place winners in the TechPitch competition were CSSE students Youwe Huang, Yuese Jin, and Dipin Patel and their company Quick Bytes.</p>

<p>On March 29th, 2014, the IEEE/ACM student chapter of Monmouth University attended the IEEE Region 1 Student Conference at NJIT. At the conference Jake Vernon, President, had the opportunity to speak on behalf of the chapter during the Student Chapter Showcase. Following the showcase was the micro-mouse competition, where Sidhdhesh Patel, James Blessing, Justin Schlemm, Zixi Li, and Jake Vernon were able to display all their hard work that had been put into the device that they had been developing for months. Unfortunately the micro-mouse hardware did not function as intended, but the team was still asked to present their micro-mouse to all the other participants. Lead Developer, Sidhdhesh Patel, Vice President, lead the discussion and answered many software-related questions since the MU IEEE/ACM chapter was the only chapter present with a Software Engineering Background. During the awards dinner at the end of the conference, the chapter received an award for their participation in the Student Chapter Showcase.</p>

<p><strong>CSSE Department to Offer New Master of Science in Information Systems Degree</strong></p>
<p>The Monmouth University Board of Trustees has approved the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering&#8217;s proposed Master of Science in Information Systems (MS-IS) degree program. The program is scheduled to be implemented starting in the Fall semester of 2014. The mission of the MS-IS program will be to integrate information technology and business management at the graduate level to provide well-trained students who would enter and be successful in local IT sectors. The goals of the program include the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>to prepare information system designers, developers, and/or administrators for successful employment;</li>
<li>to produce scholarship in the area of information systems; and</li>
<li>to provide the surrounding community with a viable opportunity to augment current information technology management skills with new and systematic knowledge.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Monmouth MS-IS program is designed to be interdisciplinary in that it brings together the fields of computer science, software engineering, and business management. The curriculum is designed to provide a sound basis for continued learning in the field beyond graduation. The degree program is designed to be either full time or part time and to prepare students for employment in the IT sector as information system developers or administrators. The program allows students to choose one of two tracks: the Technology Track or the Management Track. The Technology Track will emphasize the software life cycle, while the Management Track will emphasize information technology management and business strategic management.</p>

</div>
<p>On April 28-29, three of our Monmouth CSSE students participated in&#8211;and won&#8211;a 24-hour Hackathon called the Jersey Shore Comeback-A-Thon. Gary Kagan is currently an undergraduate Software Engineering major at Monmouth University, and Cory Cardio received his MS last year. Together with Margaret Kim, also a past CSSE student, they formed &#8220;Team Mango&#8221; and worked through the night on Saturday, developing a new and novel mobile app.</p>
<p>The theme of the event was Jersey Shore Recovery from Super Storm Sandy and featured several talks by local businesspeople describing challenges that the Shore has faced in the past six months. The Hackathon challenge was to create a software application that could help businesses and local communities recover over the upcoming summer months. Team Mango created a &#8220;crowd-sourced application where members of the community could give and receive up-to-the-minute pertinent information in the event of a disaster like Hurricane Sandy, such as which businesses had electricity. Since connecting to the Internet was an issue for many during the storm, the application would include a texting component so users could update others as well as receive updates on their phone even if they did not have a Smartphone or could not get internet access.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the dust cleared and the sun rose, the team of judges named Team Mango the winning team and awarded them the $1,000 first-prize. The event was sponsored by Marathon Data and was held at CoWerks in Asbury Park.</p>

<p><strong>Professor Obaidat Featured In Asbury Park Press Article On Digital Reading Devices</strong></p>
<p>Computer Science and Software Engineering Professor Mohammad S. Obaidat was featured in the Asbury Park Press on 2/25/2012.</p>
<p>(Excerpt:)</p>
<p>Mohammad S. Obaidat, a professor of computer science and software engineering at Monmouth University and the editor-in-chief of several technical journals, said early predictions of a paperless culture were just premature, not wholly inaccurate. A Business Week article in June 1975 offered diverging views on the paperless office, an early mention of the concept.</p>
<p>The tipping point of the decline of world paper use arrived as the Internet, e-business, e-government and social media made large strides, Obaidat said.</p>
<p>Those developments rose along with the expansion of the economies of India and China, which allowed far more people to acquire information technology devices.</p>
<p>Obaidat ticked off some of the benefits of a paperless world: fewer environmental issues like deforestation and greenhouse gas buildup, less space needed, greater searchability, reduced costs.</p>
<p>&#8220;But are we ever going to be 100 percent paperless? I doubt it,&#8221; Obaidat said.</p>
<p>Obaidat predicted that world paper consumption will decline by 75 percent by 2020.</p>
<p>Steps like Google&#8217;s efforts to digitize existing books and the widespread acceptance of electronic signatures will speed the drop.</p>

<p>For the sixth summer in a row, Monmouth University has offered a cutting-edge Computer Camp for students in middle school and high school. This camp, directed by Shauna Schubiger is taught by professors from the Software Engineering and Computer Science Departments. It is designed to provide advanced learning in computer skills, encourage teamwork, and promote creative thinking. Students have the opportunity to design their very own online portfolio to link all of the projects they create throughout the week. Sessions taught include Microsoft FrontPage and Dreamweaver for web design, Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator for graphic design, Windows Moviemaker for digital video, Alice and Flash for computer animation, Robotics, Flash for video game design, and Visual Basic for computer programming. Professors utilize a project-based learning approach to teach each different type of software to enable students to design based on their own particular interests. The culmination of this week-long camp ends with a parent showcase and the uploading of all projects to the Internet on individual student-designed websites. For more information on this camp, please contact Rebecca Hanly in the Computer Science Department at 732.571.7501.</p>

<p>The book is a primer on managing software-based development projects and complex software/hardware systems. The book discusses the application of project management and general management techniques to large software development projects and complex software/hardware systems. This practical guide allows readers to reliably develop large software applications and systems that require the simultaneous development of electronic hardware and the software that controls the hardware. Each chapter is accompanied by a case study based on a case with which the author is familiar. This gives the reader experience in doing the management work. The author teaches readers how to use their own experience to improve the way they manage projects and provides a method for reviewing successes and failures to help increase their capabilities in the future. Managing the Development of Software-Intensive Systems serves as both an introduction to project management for software and hardware developers and as an advanced material resource for experienced managers. The contents will benefit managers of software-based development projects and organizations, as well as organizations that outsource development work. The book can also be used as a textbook in undergraduate or graduate courses in computer engineering, computer science, software engineering, information technology, commerce, and business administration with an information systems orientation.</p>

<p>The book, co-authored by Dr. Noureddine A. Boudriga, is considered the only singular, all-encompassing textbook on state-of-the-art technical performance evaluation of computer and telecommunication systems. It has already been adopted for courses by several universities worldwide. It is the only available technical book to treat computer and telecommunication systems as inseparable issues. The authors explain the basic concepts of performance evaluation, applications, performance evaluation metrics, workload types, benchmarking, and characterization of workload. This is followed by a review of the basics of probability theory and, finally, the main techniques for performance evaluation—namely measurement, simulation, and analytic modeling—with case studies and examples. The book is an ideal textbook for graduate courses or senior year undergraduate courses in computer science, electrical engineering, computer engineering, software engineering, and information sciences, technology, and systems. It is also an excellent reference for practicing engineers and scientists.</p>

<p><strong>CS511 Students Produce Digital Campus Map</strong></p>
<p>A group of students from Professor Kosaka&#8217;s CS511 Technical Communication class has produced a digital campus map that is integrated with a number of information sources deemed useful for a university community. The digital campus map is designed and implemented for a campus of small to medium size such as Monmouth University. The integration of information is independent of the size of the organization. The group took an informal survey of the campuses in New Jersey, and a few outside of the state. They did not find any campus maps that had a comparable level of information integration.</p>

<p><a title="Professor Michiko Kosaka" href="https://www.monmouth.edu/directory/profiles/michiko-kosaka/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Professor Michiko Kosaka</a> gave a talk to the students at the Computer Science Academy, Freehold High School, on October 26. The talk was entitled &#8220;Analysis of Wishes,&#8221; based on the work done at the University of Wisconsin. The data came from the actual New Year&#8217;s wishes (100,000 wishes) collected by the Times Square Alliance in December of 2007, who produces the famous New Year&#8217;s Eve Ball Drop. Professor Kosaka showed the students how to analyze raw data, organize them, and create hypotheses so that appropriate data structures can be set up with a view towards data mining and machine learning. Such techniques are being developed to respond to the current demands (business intelligence, security and political intelligence, medical information) for sentiment and opinion analyses of unstructured data, especially on the internet. The students from the whole Academy attended, were very animated and asked many pertinent questions, particularly how Search Engines leverage such information.</p>

<p><strong>Graduate Program Changes Starting Academic Year 2009</strong></p>
<p>We would like to detail changes to the Graduate CS Program starting in the Fall 2009 semester.</p>
<p>The MS Degree will now require 30 credits (10 courses) for students with an adequate CS background (those who do not need to take any bridge courses). These students will be able to finish the degree in 1 calendar year (2 semesters and 1 summer).</p>
<p>In the new graduate program, new students will choose between:</p>
<ul>
<li>Track A (thesis)</li>
<li>Track B (non-thesis)</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, students will have the option of choosing one of the following areas of specialization:</p>
<ul>
<li>Databases and Intelligent Information Systems</li>
<li>Security of Networks and Information Systems</li>
<li>Computer Networks</li>
</ul>
<p>Students also will have the option of not choosing an area of specialization.</p>

<p>4/13/08</p>
<p><strong>Significant CS Program Changes Starting Academic Year 2008</strong></p>
<p>We would like to announce two recent program changes starting in the Fall 2008 semester.</p>
<p>First, our initial instructional programming language has been changed to Java from C++ for both the B.S. and M.S. programs. With this change, the typical undergraduate student will begin their study of computer science by first taking CS 120 &#8220;Foundations of Computer Science&#8221; in the fall and then learning to program using the Java programming language in CS 175 &#8220;Introduction to Computer Science I&#8221; which is offered during the spring semester. Students who have an advanced placement score of 3 or better in CS can be given credit for CS 175 and can, therefore, continue their study of Java from high school by taking CS 176 during their first semester (fall) at Monmouth. Students will be introduced to C++ when they take CS 310 &#8220;Object Oriented Programming and Design&#8221; during their junior year. In the Graduate program, the bridge courses that involve programming – CS 501A, CS 501B, and CS 503 – will now use Java for instruction. Graduate students will now be exposed to programming in C++ in CS 509.</p>
<p>Second, we now have two tracks in the B.S. program.</p>
<p>Track A: Advanced Computing. This track is recommended for students who plan to go on to a graduate degree in computer science or who are interested in mathematical or scientific computing. Honors students must take this track. The track requires 26 credits of mathematics and science outside of the major.</p>
<p>Track B: Applied Computing. The requirements within the major are identical to track A, but the only requirement outside of the major beyond the General Education requirements of Monmouth University is that the student take Math 109 &#8220;Pre-Calculus Mathematics&#8221; (or obtain an appropriate score in the mathematics placement test). This track is appropriate for students who plan to go directly to work in the software industry after graduation or to follow their undergraduate education with, for example, an M.B.A.</p>
