=== Welcome to PrismaBeat ===


If you are not familiar with rhythm games, reading this may be helpful for getting started on how to play.

W/UP - Move to previous song (on song select screen)

- GAMEPLAY -
PrismaBeat is a game about timing and accuracy. There are two types of objects that you will encounter, hit notes and hold notes. To hit a hit note, you have to hit the key corresponding to the correct lane and have the lane set to the same color. To hit a hold note, hold down the corresponding key until the entire note passes through the hit box.


The lanes are set up in the following order:
W E I O


So if a note is coming down in the first lane, hitting W when the note is completely surrounded by the hit box at the bottom will earn a VIVID.


To change the colors of the lanes, use Q/C and P/M. Q changes the color of the first and second lane. M changes the color of the third and fourth lane. The current colors of each lane are indicated by the colored prisms at the bottom of the track. 


While each chart has two unique colors to match its theme, there are only ever two colors, so hitting Q or P will always switch between the first and second color. If you hit a note with the incorrect color, it will be counted as a DULL.


- DIFFICULTY - 
In the song select screen there are numbers before each song from 1 to 10. These numbers indicate the difficulty of the songs, 1 being the easiest and 10 being the hardest.
Some songs of similar difficulties can seem easier or harder to you, the difficulty numbers are just there to give you a rough estimate of how hard a song is before you play.
Currently the easiest song is 3-BananaAllergyMonkey, and the hardest song is 10-1116.


- NOTE SPEED - 
When in the song select screen, you can change the note scroll speed with E and I. Setting the scroll speed to 25 will make the notes come down slower, and setting it to 500 will make the notes come faster. The difficulty of each chart can be greatly impacted by your scroll speed, so find a speed that works for you to play.


- PASSING AND FAILING -
Passing a song, meaning your effective rate if over 69%, which is displayed in the top right corner while playing, simply means that your skill level is equal or above the song you have played. If you fail a song, there is no punishment, it just means that you need to practice more to improve your skills to beat the chart. 
It is possible to fail a chart with a good score or fail a song with a bad score. Scoring measures your accuracy, while your effective rate measures your ability to deal with all parts of a chart.


If you want to quit in the middle of a song, press ESCAPE.


Good luck and have fun!
