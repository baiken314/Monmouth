            "description": "The Guggenheim Mansion was originally the summer home of Murry and Leonie Guggenheim. The building, completed in 1905, is built in the dignified neoclassical idiom typical of the Ecole des Beaux Arts, but the general effect is lightened by a white stucco exterior, wide arcades curving out from the east and west sides of the buildings, and a predominantly white interior. The ceilings on the first floor are lofty and numerous floor-to-ceiling doors and windows allow summer breezes to cool the rooms. The billiard room and the living room are paneled in chestnut and walnut respectively. A marble floored central corridor provides access to all the rooms on the first floor. Photographs of the cottage interior in its days as a residence show that it was decorated with restrained good taste rather than extravagance."
